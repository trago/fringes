# fringes
Python package for processing fringe patterns.

Fringes patterns are a kind of special images obtained, for example, from optical interferometry. These images have
a cosine model and can be seeing as two-dimensional cosine signals. When processing fringe patterns, the objective is 
obtain the modulating phase.

The idea of this package is to offer methods and operations to process fringe pattern images.

## Modules

- **psi** has methods and utilities used to demodulate a sequence of phase-shifting fringe patterns.
