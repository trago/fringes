# Fringe tests

The scripts in this directory run some test on a feature that is part of the package *fringes*. To run the scripts,
the package *fringes* should be in the **Python** path or in the system site packages. The short way to run this 
scripts, in unix like systems, is by setting the environment variable  

```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/fringes
```

The path is the path to the directory that contains the *fringes* package.

Once you have the *fringes* package in your python path, you can run any of these scripts by executing, for example,
the following:

```bash
$ python psi-vu_factorization.py
```
